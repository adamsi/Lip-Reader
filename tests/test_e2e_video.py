"""End-to-end tests using recorded video clips with ground truth transcripts.

Runs each clip through Auto-AVSR InferencePipeline -> Claude free-form correction,
then compares corrected text to ground truth using word-level F1.

Designed for pytest-xdist: each video is a separate parametrized test item,
distributed across workers. Use `pytest -n 4` for parallel execution.
